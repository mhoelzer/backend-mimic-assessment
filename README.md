# Mimic 
Build a "mimic" dict that maps each word that appears in the alice.txt file to a list of all the words that immediately follow that word in the file. The list of words can be be in any order and should include duplicates. So for example the key "and" might have the list ["then", "best", "then", "after", ...] listing all the words which came after "and" in the text.

With the mimic dict, it's fairly easy to emit random text that mimics the original. Print a word, then look up what words might come next and pick one at random as the next word.

For fun, feed your program to itself as input. 

In order to test if your file is functioning, you enter `python python_filename.py text_filename.txt` inside your terminal. This is like how you would test in the List and Strings assessments, but you need the extra part that specifies the file.
